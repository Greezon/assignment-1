# Refactor project - 1

### When refactoring the code, it is my top priority to leave it looking cleaner than it originally was; additionally, I ensure all of the links are working properly. I ensure the code is optimized, and there is no unneeded redundancy. Lastly it is also important that all of the styling follows a coherent, logical order. Resulting in a clean, easy to read, and easier to navigate end product. Henceforth future developers may effortlessly transform this project.

#### The first thing I noticed, was there was no flavicon on the browser tab; additionally, I added an alluring title.

Before this project, I had very little understanding of what was expected in professional HTML, and CSS files. After many hours of research I found the answers, and expectations, which allowed me to confidently refactor the given project. I was able to optimize the code, and make it considerably easie to read. Additionally I leared a bit about accessibility standards and expectations. Looking at the project now it is incredible how much easier it is to look thorugh the code and see what changes I can make and where they are on the actual webpage.

# Refactor project - 1

### When refactoring the code, it is my top priority to leave it looking cleaner than it originally was; additionally, I ensure all of the links are working properly. I ensure the code is optimized, and there is no unneeded redundancy. Lastly it is also important that all of the styling follows a coherent, logical order. Resulting in a clean, easy to read, and easier to navigate end product. Henceforth future developers may effortlessly transform this project.
